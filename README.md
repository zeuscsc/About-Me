# About Me
I want to be inventor, currently trying Foobar with Google Challenge.  I am an AI researcher that works on government and NGO projects. At the same time I teach program for a living, a programming instructor.  I was also a startup owner :sweat_smile:.
Hope to work in company like Google and SpaceX.
